# Facade

Facade is a design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

1. ___Applicability___
    * Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
    * Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers. Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem.
      You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades.
      For example, letâ€™s return to our video conversion framework. It can be broken down into two layers: video- and audio-related.
      For each layer, you can create a facade and then make the classes of each layer communicate with each another via those facades.

2. ___Pros___
    * You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

3. ___Cons___
    * A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.

4. ___Usage of the pattern in Java___
    * javax.servlet.ServletContext
    * javax.servlet.http.HttpSession

> _Identification:_ Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes.
> Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.
